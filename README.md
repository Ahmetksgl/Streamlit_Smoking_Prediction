## Project Description:

**This project contains a machine learning model developed to predict smoking behavior. Since smoking has significant effects on health, the goal of this project is to create a model capable of predicting smoking behavior.**

### Dataset Description:

**The utilized dataset includes various features that may influence smoking behavior. Several analyses have been conducted to understand the relationships between variables and evaluate the performance of the model.**

### Machine Learning Model:

**The model used in this project is trained using [LGBM].**

**Additionally, Pandas was used for data analysis, scikit-learn for machine algorithm, and plotly.express for data visualization.**

### Streamlit:

**Web application got made with streamlit.**
